TOPIC: 
Build an app whose main functionality is to copy items (files and folders) from one online storage account to another.

This project is based on a code assignment for developer candidates which PDF can be found in the _docs folder.

This is a demo version with no intention to cover every functionality provided by either storage provider API.
It will stricly stick to the assignment spec.



REQUIREMENTS:
- Requires PHP 7.0+ to run
- Requires Google API client 2.0+
- Uses Dropbox API v2

INSTALLATION:
- If the folder "vendor" is not present, run the command "composer install"
- For the purpose of having the app running without further setup, it is provided with clients id and secret,
    but they will be canceled in time. Feel free to create your own apps per storage provider, generate
    the corresponding ids and secrets and place them in the place them in the corresponding file 
    located in the folder "client-secrets" (see documentation below)

EXECUTION:
- In a terminal console, run the commande "php run.php" from the root directory
- You will be prompt during the first run to follow a web link to authorize the app with both storage providers.
    Just follow the instructions, copy/paste the give token and you are good to go until Google's token expires
    then you will prompt to refresh the authorization/the token.



As there are only 2 providers implemented, the app only prompt for the source choice, the destination being 
defected to the remainer, although this would only require a few changes in the run flow.

As it is a CLI app, you will be asked to copy/paste character strings either from within the app itself or from your browser.

The run flow is fairly straight forward and captions help you at every steps.
